# PWA Budget Tracker

## Description

This budget tracker allows users to keep track of their budget while they are travelling. They can enter the name of the transaction and the amount of that transaction and it will be added to a list and represented in a graph. The app will also work offline so the users can still track their budget with little to no internet connection.
